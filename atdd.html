		<p class="introduction">Wouldn't it be great to have a technique that prevents defects from being introduced into your code base?</p>
		<p class="introduction">That is probably the question many responsible for software development are asking themselves. Actually,
		such a technique has been known for as long as programmers have been writing code. How? We simply write the
		test <strong>before</strong> the production code and execute it.</p>

		<h2 class="caimito-main-color">Executable Specification</h2>
		<p>With a simple <strong>mindshift</strong> we can develop software more <strong>effectively</strong>.</p>
		<p>Instead of relying on extensive specifications, handed off to programmers as blueprints from someone else,
		the whole team collaborates. Together we create an executable specification, code that drives and tests the
		production code, that not only tells us where we are but also serves as a <strong>warning system</strong>
		telling us when things that used to work break.</p>

He is able to understand the coaching needed by a team and also update the technology stack to support the team and his coaching plan. Stephan helped us with Acceptance Test Driven Development on a number of technology stacks including web applications, Windows application and COBOL in addition to the tradition Java technology stack. I would both recommend and hire Stephan.</span>

		<p>We put the focus on the expected <strong>behavior</strong> of the production code and we state that 
		<strong>first</strong> before diving into the details. So that we get it <strong>right</strong> from the start.</p>
		<p>By having tests in place for every piece of code we can <strong>trust</strong> our building blocks for the 
		larger piece. Instead of believing that we may have done it right, we have <strong>proof</strong> at every turn 
		of the way and can work with confidence. <strong>No sweaty hands before demos!</strong></p>

		<h3 class="caimito-green-color">TDD vs. ATDD</h3>
		<p>Classic TDD (Test-Driven Development) and ATDD are essentially two sides of the same coin. In both
		cases we want to describe, in code, what some piece of software does before we write the code for it.
		The main difference is that TDD is by programmers for programmers and focuses on the little details
		so that we can create software out of many trusted building blocks. ATDD is an outside-in approach where
		we describe what the system does on a more granular level. Because we are looking at the system from the 
		outside inwards we can use ATDD to collaborate well with testers and business analysts on the team.</p>

		<h2 class="caimito-main-color">Specification By Example</h2>
		<p><em>Let me give you an example</em></p>
		<p>Examples are a great way to explain what someone is looking for. In <strong>conversations</strong> with other people
		we use examples all the time to illustrate what we mean.</p>

		<p>Specification by Example is a powerful technique to communicate requirements for a software solution
		to the technical team that gets the <strong>point across</strong>, fosters team/stakeholder 
		<strong>collaboration</strong> and helps to build the <strong>right thing</strong>.</p>
