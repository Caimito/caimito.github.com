<p>The European Union has introduced a number of new laws to protect personal data inside and outside of the EU. We as a European company need to comply with the rules set forth in <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679&amp;from=EN#d1e40-1-1">EU regulation (EU) 2016/679</a>.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>We don’t want to put up a lot of complicated legal text here. We believe you won’t read it or be quickly bored by it. So we try to keep it short and to the point and use some common sense with regards to General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>

<p>This Data Protection Policy applies to all services, websites and other data processing facilities under the second-level domain caimito.net.</p>

<p>If you decide to buy a product or service from us, we ask you to create an account, which we call <em>Caimito ID</em>.
