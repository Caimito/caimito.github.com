<h1>The Learning Organization</h1>
<h3 class="caimito-green-color">How to benefit from change</h3>
<p class="introduction">Today, people are increasingly more aware and concerned about the environment 
they live and work in. Life and work has become more interconnected and more global.
This has resulted in faster change and creates new challenges for organizations to 
reach their customers and retain smart collaborators.</p>

		<h2 class="caimito-main-color">Agile Practices</h2>
		<p>Caimito's <strong>practicioners</strong> have been using agile practices in their daily work 
		<strong>many years before</strong> it was called <strong>Agile</strong>. Showing progress by 
		delivering working software to real human users feels as natural to us as to a fish swimming 
		in the water.</p>
		<p>However, we understand that not everyone is familiar with the kind of environment 
		where <em>water</em> is actually recognized as the most natural thing. That is why we offer
		our clients our help so that they can learn how to create a learning environment and sustain it.</p>
			
		<blockquote class="client"><span>Stephan is one of few people that truly understands the process and nuisances of building software in the real world. When it comes to Scrum, Agile and maximizing the efficiency and happiness of a team of developers there is no one I would trust more than him.</span>
			<p>Brian Sam-Bodden, Integrallis Software, 2007</p>
		</blockquote>	

		<h3 class="caimito-green-color">Be agile vs. Do Agile</h3>
		<p>Adopting agile practices and processes like Scrum or Kanban is <strong>not</strong> the 
		<strong>goal</strong> for a learning organization.</p>
		<p>Instead we help our clients to become more agile by using an approach to coaching that itself is
		based on <strong>inspect-and-adapt</strong>. Depending on where you and your teams are at we start with the most simple
		practices that help to work more <strong>effective</strong> and add gradually other practices that fit and help
		to develop. Our approach is <strong>free of dogma</strong> so that your organization can become agile and not 
		be doing Agile.</p>

		<blockquote class="client"><span>Stephan is both conscientious and competent. His knowledge of design patterns and programming tools is extensive. He is highly disciplined and not only follows, but enforces the XP methodology.</span>
			<p>Rupert Bruce, Senior Developer, RealWorld Systems, 2007</p>

		<h2 class="caimito-main-color">Lean Startup</h2>
		<p>Whether you have a great business idea and want to form a startup or you are responsible for a department
		within a medium or large enterprise Caimito can help you to be successful with your venture.</p>
		<p>Our practicioners have <strong>done</strong> many times what <strong>you</strong> are about to 
		<strong>begin</strong>. They have <strong>learned</strong> their lessons
		and drawn their <strong>conclusions</strong>. Now, they are able to share what works and what doesn't.</p>

		<h3 class="caimito-green-color">International Experience</h3>
		<p>We have been around. We know how local culture influences how businesses are run, how customers react and how
		to treat and work with the local people.</p>
		<p>We have intimate <strong>experience</strong> in running a business in <strong>Europe</strong>, 
		the <strong>United States</strong> and <strong>Latin America</strong>. The music plays differently in all those
		places.</p>

		<h2 class="caimito-main-color">Organizational Development</h2>
		<p>Traditionally managed organizations can be turned into adaptive systems that are able to reinvent themselves
		whenever the market conditions change.</p>

		<p>Humans are permanent learners. Nobody has to teach an infant to walk, speak and understand the world
		around them. Toddlers continue this in more complex domains. When we enter adulthood we continue 
		learning. But we might learn the wrong things. We might learn to fear superiors and not serve the
		customer. We might learn to go with the flow instead of expressing the insight we just had. We might
		learn to climb up the corporate ladder quicker or what it takes to jump ship instead of how to
		collaborate better across boundaries in the organization for the benefit of the organization and its
		customers.</p>
		<p>In a learning organization we re-learn to see the whole and connect the dots instead of just
		performing well in the silos we find ourselves in.</p>
