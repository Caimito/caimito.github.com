<h1>Activity-Centered Design</h1>
<p class="introduction">Many times simply the wrong software is created. It may work very well. 
It may look good and is easy to use. But the organization that paid for it does not get the benefit 
from it as expected. It's because a great solution can solve the <strong>wrong problem.</strong></p>

			Stephan Schwab has written a book that teaches readers how to apply	<strong>Activity Theory</strong>
			to Software Development. Drawing from a long history of <strong>psychology</strong> and <strong>philosophy</strong>
			Activity Theory can help practicioners to better understand what people want to do <strong>through</strong>
			software. Based on that Activity-Centered Design is a practice that enables a <strong>whole team</strong> of
			<strong>software designers</strong> to create a solution that solves the <strong>right problem</strong>
			and <strong>delights customers</strong>.</p>
