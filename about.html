		<h3>Stephan Schwab</h3>
		<h4 class="caimito-green-color subheader">Software Development Consultant &amp; Coach</h4>
		<p>Stephan started writing code sometime back in 1981. Since then he has worked on
		a large number of different platforms using about 20 different programming languages. His 
		own successful failures and those of others made him realize that all too often organizations 
		create software that solves the wrong problem. His current work focuses on activities and 
		how software can be created that better allows people to perform what they want to do.</p>
		<p>He has lived and worked in his native Germany, about 5 years in the United States, 
		and about 6 years in different countries of Latin America - so far. Stephan speaks German, 
		English, and Spanish.</p>
		<p>When he is not coaching, teaching or otherwise engaged in client work Stephan speaks at
		international conferences or visits industry gatherings - or simply enjoys some free time with
		family and his horse, a Peruvian Paso.</p>

		<h3>Smarter Software with Activity-Centered Design</h3>
		<p>To many, the word design only describes how something looks but in fact it means how it works and looks. Well designed products are created based on a deep understanding of which activities users want to perform and are well engineered. This fitness makes these products superior to their competition and in some cases such products shake up an entire industry. This book shows how Activity Theory can be used to create smarter software. You will learn how a sucessful software development team can effectively work with users and stakeholders to deliver high quality solutions.</p>
