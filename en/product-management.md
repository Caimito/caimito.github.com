# Product Management
For your organization we create a product-centric organization. Initially we will provide all the necessary personel but eventually your - likely newly hired - internal staff will take over.

There are two ways how we can build a new software product together:

- [Custom Software Development](development.html) with your own Product Management staff
- Create a product-centric organization in DevOps style to build and operate the software product

## Product-centric organization
Customers and product are key and center.

## DevOps
DevOps means that we create a cross-functional team comprised of specialists for software Development and Operations. We make sure that nobody outside the core team is required to add features to the software product and to operate it.

## Cost effective SaaS operation without a vendor cloud
In recent years many companies have moved "to the cloud" and then found themselves facing huge monthly bills from vendors. We believe that using someone else's computer isn't a very smart move. Some companies have learned that lesson and are now doing their "cloud exit". Some are even vocal about that and share numbers about how much they are no saving by running their own infrastructure again.

We are old enough to know how to run a datacenter and infrastructure and can help you to reap the benefits of "cloud computing" without the huge bills that are usually attached to it.
