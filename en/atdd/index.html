		<p class="introduction">
			Acceptance Test-Driven Development is a technique to improve collaboration amongst team members in order to
			improve product quality. The result will be software better suited for the target purpose and audience. At the
			same time, the software will be easier to maintain. This reduces your exposure to risk and protects the huge
			investment your company is making by developing a software product.

		<h3 class="caimito-main-color">Some key success factors</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Team members and key managers invest into making the product testable</li>
			<li>Where needed product architecture gets refactored</li>
			<li>Product Managers participate in creating a specification collaboratively and iteratively</li>
			<li>Set aside additional time for feature planning</li>
			<li>Make features as small as possible</li>
			<li>Create a chain of small features as an on-ramp to a bigger feature</li>

		<h2>ATDD in a nutshell</h2>
		<p>Acceptance Test-Driven Development follows the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method"
				target="_blank">scientific method</a>. Development follows these simple, time-tested steps:</p>

			<p style="font-weight: bold">Learn as much as you can about the customer problem</p>

			<p>Product Management creates meaningful examples of what customers would like to do with the software product.
				The examples at this stage don't have to follow any formal notation but if people feel comfortable enough, over
				time they will, they can write them as sentences following the Given/When/Then pattern.</p>

			<p>Those examples help the technical team (testers, programmers) to understand that the problem to be solved
				really is. They also help to convey the customer context to the technical team.</p>
			<p>These examples are the starting point for acceptance criteria and tests.</p>
