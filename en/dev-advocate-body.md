# Senior Developer Advocate
The Senior Developer Advocate is an experienced software developer who temporarily works within your team, with a particular focus on improving the technical and organizational skills of the team members. The Senior Developer Advocate actively contributes to the software solution provided by the team and is thus an additional developer.

## Benefits for Your Company
In times of tight budgets and many new challenges, the Senior Developer Advocate is a very cost-effective way to dramatically improve the overall performance of the team.

Instead of investing in hiring more software developers, testers, business analysts, Product Owners, Scrum Masters, etc., the Senior Developer Advocate improves the skills of the existing people. There is no need for onboarding, the overall costs are significantly lower, and as a pleasant side effect, the quality of the code even increases.

## Far Better Than Training - and Cheaper
The Senior Developer Advocate is an additional team member and can therefore make the right offers in the right context situationally. They provide the solution for the given problem, and training happens "on the job" and is essentially free. Here are some examples:

Continuous Deployment (CD)
: So far, the team delivers a new version of the software at the end of the scrum sprint, e.g., every 2 weeks. Instead of a complex switch to *Continuous Deployment*, the Senior Developer Advocate finds opportunities to automate more and more steps of *build*, *test*, and *deployment*. Through many small *quick wins*, an infrastructure is gradually created that eventually enables *Continuous Deployment*. The Senior Developer Advocate either implements these things independently or involves other team members in the style of *pair programming*. Not only is a solution delivered, but sustainable knowledge and skills are built. Without much effort, the team is even on the path to *DevOps*.

Test-Driven Development (TDD)
: There are many texts and trainings on TDD. Unfortunately, test-driven development is far from easy. Existing code often poses an insurmountable hurdle, and in almost all cases, TDD is then rejected or abandoned. In the end, reliance continues on dedicated testers, the code becomes difficult to modify, and *technical debt* increases. The Senior Developer Advocate, with years of practice, has a sense for the right moment, for the right situation, and guides the other team developers toward TDD.

Executable Specification
: Especially in larger companies, communication between the development team and internal clients is often difficult, and perfect solutions for the wrong problem are often developed. The Senior Developer Advocate meets with the clients - *stakeholders* - to find out where the issues lie. One possible solution is the careful introduction of ATDD (Acceptance Test-Driven Development), which uses an executable specification, e.g., with the tool Cucumber or alternatives, to make the requirements written in natural language testable. This ensures that what is ordered is delivered.

## Duration of the Engagement
The duration of the Senior Developer Advocateâ€™s engagement is generally not limited. They are primarily another team member - albeit with a special task. Many engagements last 6-12 months. It is helpful to structure the collaboration dynamically or in intervals, e.g., every second week.

For the price of a single developer, your company gets a developer, a consultant, a trainer, and the accumulated experience of many companies with the Senior Developer Advocate.

## Structure of a Typical Engagement as a Senior Developer Advocate
Performance monitoring is crucial for any investment. A clear structure and communication are essential elements.

- Assessment and Interviews
- Planning Actions (Coaching Map)
- Practical Work
- Performance Monitoring
- Phasing Out

**Assessment and Interviews**
: Before we can begin, we need to understand where we currently stand. What is working well, and where are the difficulties, challenges, and deficiencies?
: Depending on the team's size and the scope of the existing software, various interviews are conducted over one to two weeks, and existing technical processes are analyzed in depth. This includes a *technical review* of the existing software.

**Coaching Map to Define Actions and Expected Outcomes**
: Based on the insights from the assessment, we collaboratively develop a coaching map. Similar to a [Story Map](/de/kbase/story-map.html), this map outlines potential actions, as well as their temporal and contextual relationships. This coaching map then becomes our shared plan and also serves as a tool for performance monitoring.

**Practical Work**
: 60% to 70% of the practical work of the Senior Developer Advocate involves contributing to the development of the software solution the team is working on. Thus, this role is clearly that of a team member and developer, not just about training.

: Focusing on practical work as a developer fosters acceptance of both the person and the proposed actions by the other team members.

: The previously mentioned coaching map is constantly visible to all team members, and the Senior Developer Advocate actively seeks the right timing and opportunities to implement training objectives and actions in a situational and personal manner.

**Phasing Out Phase**
: After some time, the engagement will end, and the phasing-out phase will begin. For sustainability, this phase should start no later than 12 months. The involvement of the Senior Developer Advocate is reduced, and the focus shifts more towards observing and guiding the team.

: The goal is to end the engagement entirely after a few weeks of reduced presence. It can be resumed if needed.


## Success Monitoring
Regular meetings with senior management or department heads serve as success monitoring. The focus is on clear goals, what has been achieved, and where there are difficulties. The Senior Developer Advocate is also a business consultant and may, for example, suggest changes to the organizational structure of the company.
