<h1>Available And Planned Seminars</h1>
<p class="introduction">As an introduction to several topics I offer half-day and full-day seminars in many locations
	across Europe in <strong>English</strong>, <strong>German</strong>, and <strong>Spanish</strong>. Please have a look
	at what is scheduled or planned. Or let me know what would be helpful for you and we find a way to make it happen in
	your location.</p>

<p class="introduction">For events in <strong>German</strong> please see the <a href="/de/seminars.html">German language
		version of this page</a>.</p>

<p class="introduction">If you are interested in participating in one of these events, please let me know via email to
	<a href="mailto:sns@caimito.net">sns@caimito.net</a>.

		<ul>
			<li>France
				<ul>
					<li>Bordeaux</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Netherlands</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Currently I'm working on a concept for a workshop about <a href="acd.html">Activity-Centered Design</a>.</p>

<p style="background-color: #FFFFE0">In general these events should be kept as <strong>affordable as possible</strong>.
	I am not a training vendor. My motivation for doing these events is to introduce people to new techniques, new
	concepts, new ways of doing their work. The exact price per participant depends on the number of participants, the
	venue, catering, and my own travel expenses. Of course, I'm more than happy to perform such an event for a private
	group.</p>
<p>In order to keep it affordable and make reservation of a good venue and travel arrangements easier, tickets for
	public events will be offered for an early bird price and a regular price. All tickets have to be paid in full a few
	days before the event takes place.</p>
