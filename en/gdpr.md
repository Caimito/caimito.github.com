# Data Protection Policy
The European Union has introduced a number of new laws to protect personal data inside and outside of the EU. We as a European company need to comply with the rules set forth in [EU regulation (EU) 2016/679](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679&from=EN#d1e40-1-1).

## Introduction
We don't want to put up a lot of complicated legal text here. We believe you won't read it or be quickly bored by it. So we try to keep it short and to the point and use some common sense with regards to General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

This Data Protection Policy applies to all services, websites and other data processing facilities under the second-level domain caimito.net.

Contact details: Caimito Agile Life S.L., Apartado de Correos #30, 14440 Villanueva de Cordoba, Spain

## We value your privacy
We are not interested in your data. Neither you or your data is our product. If you decide to buy a product or service from us, we appreciate your business. We have no reason to sell any information about you or disclose it to anybody except when required by law. That's why we always ask you for the bare minimum of information necessary to perform the transaction.

## How we collect information and what information we keep
We ask for your contact information and your name so that we can reply to your inquiry.

Our websites does make use of cookies to function properly. Cookies are small bits of data that are stored exclusively on your own device and cannot be read by anyone but the service that placed them there. Your device allows you to see and manage the cookies stored. 

Some portions of our websites also uses external services, like Google Analytics, to provide statistics about how many requests our website receives. We do not control how external services collect or control data.

In order to monitor the health of our systems extensive logging happens. The information stored in server logs does not refer to people but to devices or software components. When you access our website, such as for reading this text, your request has been logged with the IP address currently assigned to your device.

When you sign up for one of our newsletters, we ask for your email address so that we can send you email.

If you decide to buy a product or service from us, we ask you to create an account, which we call *Caimito ID*. Again, we are not interested in anything but the bare minimum to deliver you the product or service you are buying. If you order a physical product, we need your shipping address. If you want an invoice, we need an address for that.

If you have created your personal *Caimito ID* for doing business with us, you can see what information we have and you can manage the information yourself. Keep in mind that deleting information from the portal may result in the need to enter it again.

## Where we store your information
Your information is stored on our own systems. Critical information, such as a credit card number for subsequent purchases, is stored encrypted.

Our shop system keeps a record of your past purchases. If you feel uncomfortable about the fact that we know what you bought from us in the past, you may decide to buy in a physical store and pay with cash to maintain your anonymity. Keep in mind not to return to the same shop.

## What we use your information for
We use your information to keep in touch with you, to provide you a service or deliver you a product based on your order.

If you want to remove any of the information we store and you have created yourself a *Caimito ID*, you can delete it from the portal. Keep in mind though that you may have to provide it again. We can't deliver a physical product to your email address.

We have no way to know who you are based on the server logs mentioned above. An IP address is not enough information without additional data. The additional data might be available to law enforcement who can obtain it from your access provider.

## Who is responsible for your information at our company
Stephan Schwab (sns@caimito.net) is responsible for your information. Feel free to ask any question by sending email, if you have any concerns.

## How to complain
If you wish to complain about anything with regards to your personal data, please send email to info@caimito.net and we will address your concern without delay.
