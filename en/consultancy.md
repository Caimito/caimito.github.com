	<p>Similar to <strong>coaches in sports</strong>, Stephan Schwab and associates can help you and your teams to
		<strong>improve</strong> the <strong>effectiveness</strong> of your work and the <strong>contribution</strong> to
		the overall <strong>value creation chain</strong> within the company. With pleasure we introduce new techniques for
		software development, test, project management and product development to your teams and leadership. Included in
		that is to improve the collaboration amongst management, teams and team members.
	</p>
	<p>We are not process consultants or sellers of any particular methodology. Our focus is on uplifting skills of all		contributors in your organization so that the company as a whole improves and becomes fitter for the challenges		ahead.
	</p>

## We Focus on the Organization as a Whole
In an arc spanning from the technical side of the enterprise all the way to the strategic decision making side we try to optimize the enterprise as a whole. We figure out where in the value stream we can optimize without compromising something important. This can lead to cost savings which frees money for future initiatives.

Most importantly, we don't want to increase your headcount or require you to use additional services.

Our associates can act as **Senior Developer Advocate** or as **Entrepreneurial Consultant** with good information sharing between them.

## The Learning Team in a Learning Organization
<p>Teams are the smallest unit able to learn within an organization. Workgroups made of specialists deliver inferior
	performance because those specialists frequently are unable to truly collaborate. Success comes from technical
	capabilities. Sustainable long-term success comes from organizational capabilities.</p>

<p>Embedded into your team, working as an active member who makes meaningful contributions to your software product,
	the <a href="developer-advocate.html"><strong>Senior Developer Advocate</strong></a> makes your development effort
	more effective. Consequently, efficiency increases. Your organization gets working software solutions to business
	problems earlier.
</p>
<p>
	By being able to adapt quicker to changing markets and customer demands you will be able to outperform your
	competition.
</p>
<p>The embedded <a href="developer-advocate.html"><strong>Senior Developer Advocate</strong></a> is a very cost
	effective way to increase the technical skills of each team member without losing productivity by sending everyone to
	classroom training which is often general and not specific to your needs.</p>

		<h2>Organizational Capabilities</h2>
		<p>Teams with well-developed organizational capabilities are able to act purposefully in accordance with the
			corporate purpose and continue to make useful decisions.</p>
		<p>Scrum and Kanban are useful to develop general organizational capabilities.</p>
	</div>

	<div>
		<h2>Technical Capabilities</h2>
		<p>The difference between a team of advanced professionals and a team of really experienced professionals is
			caused by continuous learning. Masters of their craft are what they are because of years of practice with
			well-suited techniques.</p>
		<p><a href="atdd.html"><strong>Acceptance Test-Driven Development (ATDD)</strong></a> and <strong>Test-Driven
				Development (TDD)</strong> are useful
			techniques to develop technical excellence.</p>
		<p><a href="/en/blog/2024/09/17/continuous-integration.html"><strong>Continuous Integration (CI)</strong></a> in combination with <strong>Continuous Deployment (CD)</strong> to
			production systems helps to reap the benefits of an investment, the software being created, much sooner. Rapid
			feedback from actual users of that software also ensures that you and your team stay on the right track. </p>
		<p>Instead of struggling with complexity and lots of moving parts we help your team with <strong>trunk-based
				development</strong>
			instead of complicated branching strategies and tooling. Being able to <strong>deploy to production many times per
				day</strong> is
			what we aim for and we help you to do it without fear.</p>

<h2>Team Coaching</h2>
<p>To enable teams to purposefully work for the company they must have technical and organizational capabilities,
	which are helpful for the company. The development of these skills is through learning with the help of a team
	coach. Some call that role <em>Agile Coach</em>, others say <em>Senior Developer Advocate</em> or simply <em>Technical
		Team Coach</em>.</p>
<p>We do respect the knowledge and experience of you and all team members. We come to augment what you are already doing
	well. Our exposure to all the good things in many companies allows us to bring the best to your organization.</p>
