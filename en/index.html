		<p>Welcome!<br/>My name is <a href="about-sns.html">Stephan Schwab</a>. I'm the owner of Caimito Technologies and part of a network comprised of coaches for software and organizational development.<p>
		<p>I help <strong>CEOs</strong> and <strong>Department Leaders</strong> to <strong>improve</strong> the <strong>value creation chain</strong> within their organization and to improve the <strong>quality</strong> of the product they are making.</p> 
		<p>With over 30 years of experience in the software industry in Europe, North and Central America I coach and train the individual members of your teams. Together we develop their technical and organizational abilities to add new capabilities to your teams and your organization. Our mutual goal is to turn a group of specialists working side by side into a team able to quickly adapt when facing new challenges.</p>

<h2 class="caimito-main-color" style="font-weight: bold">Benefits for you and your company</h2>
<p>Similar to a <strong>coach in sports</strong>, I can help you and your teams to <strong>improve</strong> the <strong>effectiveness</strong> of your work and the <strong>contribution</strong> to the overall <strong>value creation chain</strong> within the company. It is my pleasure to introduce new techniques for software development, test, project management and product development to your teams and leadership. Included in that is to improve the collaboration amongst management, teams and team members.</p>

		<h2 class="caimito-main-color">The Learning Team</h2>
		<p>Teams are the smallest unit able to learn within an organization. Workgroups made of specialists deliver inferior performance because those specialists frequently are unable to truly collaborate. Success comes from technical capabilities. Sustainable long-term success comes from organizational capabilities.</p>

			<h2 class="caimito-green-color">Organizational Capabilities</h2>
			<p>Teams with well-developed organizational capabilities are able to act purposefully in accordance with the corporate purpose and continue to make useful decisions.</p>
			<p>Scrum and Kanban are useful to develop general organizational capabilities.</p>

			<h2 class="caimito-green-color">Technical Capabilities</h2>
			<p>The difference between a team of advanced professionals and a team of really experienced professionals is caused by continuous learning. Masters of their craft are what they are because of years of practice with well-suited techniques.</p>

		<h2 class="caimito-main-color">Team Coaching</h2>
		<p>To enable teams to purposefully work for the company they must have technical and organizational capabilities, which are helpful for the company. The development of these skills is through learning with the help of a team coach.</p>
