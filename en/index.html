    <h2>Technical Consultancy</h2>

    <h3>Senior Developer Advocate</h3>
    <p>Embedded into your team, working as an active member who makes meaningful contributions to your software product,
      the Senior Developer Advocate makes your development effort more effective. Consequently, efficiency increases.
      Your organization gets working software solutions to business problems earlier.</p>
    <p>The embedded Senior Developer Advocate is a very cost effective way to increase the technical skills of each
      team member without losing productivity by sending everyone to classroom training which is often general and not
      specific to your needs.</p>

    <h3>Technical Advisor</h3>
    <p>We have extensive experience in the field. In a similar way as medical doctors perform peer consultations we can
      do technical assessments before wide ranging decisions.</p>

    <h2>Technical Recruiting</h2>
    <p>Finding truly the right people for software development teams is very difficult. Software developers' experience
      cannot be evaluated in the same manner as other professions. Seniority is not indicated by using
      the same techniques, tools, frameworks, programming languages for many years. In fact the longer a developer does
      the same, the less experience the person actually is.</p>

    <p>We can assist your organization by reviewing candidates or assisting in the search for suitable people. </p>

    <h2>Product Management</h2>
    <p>With our help you get working software in front of actual users sooner. We manage to ship early and often. We
      help you to measure the impact of the new software solution - either as a software product available on the open
      market or just for use within your organization.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Custom Software Development</h2>
    <p>We can develop customer software for you or augment an existing development for a while to build top notch
      software that will be easy to maintain in the future. If you augment your team, your team's skill will be improved
      and the benefit will outlive our presence for a long time.</p>
