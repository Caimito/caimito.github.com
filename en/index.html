		<h2 class="caimito-green-color">Technical Consultancy</h2>
		<p>I help CEOs and Department Leaders to improve the value creation chain within their organization and to improve the quality of the product they are making.</p> 
		<p>With over 30 years of experience in the software industry in Europe, North and Central America I coach and train the individual members of your teams. Together we develop their technical and organizational abilities to add new capabilities to your teams and your organization. Our mutual goal is to turn a group of specialists working side by side into a team able to quickly adapt when facing new challenges.</p>
		<p>Teams with well-developed organizational capabilities are able to act purposefully in accordance with the corporate purpose and continue to make useful decisions.</p>
		<p>Scrum and Kanban are useful to develop general organizational capabilities.</p>
		<p>eXtreme Programming (XP) and DevOps practices help to make and deliver high quality software continuously.</p>

		<h2 class="caimito-main-color">Regenerative Farm</h2>
		<p>Organizations can be created to either exploit or regenerate something. The intent of the organization's leadership determines the methods and techniques being used and defines the behavior of everyone working in the organization.</p>
    <p>People with a regenerative mindset have come up with methods and techniques such as Agile Software Development, DevOps, Lean Manufacturing, Beyond Budgeting, Permaculture and Holistic Management - just to name a few.</p>
    <p>Together with our farm team I build, operate and maintain an organic farming operation based on these principles in Andalucia, Spain.</p>
    <p>We practice Regenerative Agriculture which means we design living systems that are able to regenerate themselves and thus provide a high yield with little or no external input.</p>
