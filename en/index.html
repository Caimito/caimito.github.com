			<p>Methods, techniques, and the mindset from Agile Software Development have shown up in other industries as well. In the world of industrial production there is Lean Manufacturing or the Toyota Production System (TPS). In agriculture the very same ideas are called Permaculture and Holistic Management.</p>
      <p>We build, operate and maintain an organic farming operation based on these principles in Andalucia, Spain.</p>
