		<h2 class="caimito-main-color">The Learning Team</h2>
		<p>Teams are the smallest unit able to learn within an organization. Workgroups made of specialists deliver inferior performance because those specialists frequently are unable to truly collaborate. Success comes from technical capabilities. Sustainable long-term success comes from organizational capabilities.</p>

			<p>The difference between a team of advanced professionals and a team of really experienced professionals is caused by continuous learning. Masters of their craft are what they are because of years of practice with well-suited techniques.</p>

		<h2 class="caimito-main-color">Team Coaching</h2>
		<p>To enable teams to purposefully work for the company they must have technical and organizational capabilities, which are helpful for the company. The development of these skills is through learning with the help of a team coach.</p>
