# About Caimito Agile Life SL
Founded in 2017 in the Spanish province of Cordoba in Andalusia, Caimito Agile Life has two areas of activity:

- Improving software development
- Preserving a piece of Dehesa through regenerative agriculture

At first glance, the combination of software development and agriculture may seem unusual. In fact, both have a lot in common. Both are areas full of complexity. Things do not always go according to plan. One often has to respond sensibly to new events. In agriculturels, there are many unknown unknowns (factors) - just as is the case in dynamic markets.

				Stephan Schwab has been programming since 1981 and has worked on a variety of different platforms and with about 20
				different programming languages. His own successful mistakes and those of others led to
				the realization that too often companies develop software that solves the wrong problem. In his
				current role, he focuses primarily on what users and companies really want to do with software
				and how to develop software that excites customers.</p>
		<p>He grew up in Germany and has lived and worked in various countries. He speaks fluent German, English, and Spanish.</p>
		<p>During his time in Panama, he developed an interest and enthusiasm for the quieter life in the countryside, there more
				in the rainforest, and gained extensive experience in dealing with horses, especially Peruvian Paso horses.
				In addition, he holds a pilot's license with an instrument rating and uses the light aircraft
				as a flexible means of transportation.</p>
		<p>When the opportunity arises, he gives lectures at national and international conferences or participates
				in industry meetings at home and abroad. More about Stephan Schwab can be found on his personal blog:</p>

		<h3>Smarter Software with Activity-Centered Design</h3>
		<p>To many, the word design only describes how something looks but in fact it means how it works and looks. Well
			designed products are created based on a deep understanding of which activities users want to perform and are well
			engineered. This fitness makes these products superior to their competition and in some cases such products shake
			up an entire industry. This book shows how Activity Theory can be used to create smarter software. You will learn
			how a sucessful software development team can effectively work with users and stakeholders to deliver high quality
			solutions.</p>

		<h2>Project Granja Caimito</h2>
		<p>Our Granja Caimito project aims to produce food for people in a sustainable way that mimics a natural ecosystem. Some people call this approach regenerative agriculture.</p>
		<p>We are not looking to exploit the ecosystem, but we strive to create abundance so that we can take the surplus for human consumption without forcing the entire system into decline.</p>
		<p>Our land covers 45 hectares and is located in the Valle de los Pedroches in Andalusia, Spain. It is situated in an ancient agroforestry system called Dehesa in Spanish. The landscape is dominated by oaks, and not much remains of the other vegetation that once existed. <strong>The soil is mostly damaged and contains very little organic material.</strong> The following image is from the summer of 2022:</p>

		<h2>ERP System for Regenerative Landscape</h2>
		<p>We use a fully self-developed ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) system for all aspects of the agricultural enterprise.</p>
		<p><a href="https://www.granja.eu">Granja EU</a> is multi-tenant capable and could develop into a standalone product.</p>
