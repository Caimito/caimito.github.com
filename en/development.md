  <p>You have a great idea for a software product but don't have the technical team to actually develop it and bring it to market? We can help you with that.</p>

  <p>You have a great product management team and are good at marketing too but lack the staff to set up another software development team for a new product. We can help you with that.</p>

  <p>Our custom software development service is designed to either augment your existing team or set up a new team altogether. Our other practices like Technical Consultancy and Technical Recruiting contribute to this.</p>

## Our Approach
Every software development project is unique. In general, we do follow the approach outlined below. We aim to quickly reap benefits of the investment and prioritize for ease of change and easily replaceable parts. The world around us is not standing still and one who adapts more rapidly will be fitter for the future than others.

<div class=sequence>
  <div class="step">
    Discovery Meeting
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>Your team and some of us will meet in order to get to know each other and find out if we are a good match for a longer-term business relationship.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="step">
    Budget Finding
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>Custom software development is an ongoing activity over several months or even years. Together, we define a budget that will allow us to dedicate a large enough effective team to the development effort.</p>
    <p>In order to control and mitigate risk the initial budget should well cover the development of the <em>walking skeleton</em> and a few key features. Development by its very nature is not a risk-free venture and we want to make sure that we deliver something of value to you within a reasonable timeframe.</p>

  <div class="step">
    Team Formation
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>We form a cross-functional team which is comprised of people from your organization and our associates. Our work style is fully remote.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="step">
    Walking Skeleton
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>Once the team has been formed the very first step is to create what we call a <em>walking skeleton</em> and have it deployed for real to a production environment.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Automated quality control</li>
      <li>Automated deployment to a staging environment for exploratory testing and feature validation</li>
      <li>For SaaS:
        <ul>
          <li>automated deployment to the production environment</li>
          <li>Ability to roll back a deployment</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>For on-premises software:
        <ul>
          <li>automated packaging for distribution and trial installation</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The <em>walking skeleton</em> contains one simple feature of all the potential features that your product team envisions.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="step">
    Feature Development & Ongoing Operation
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>Once the foundation for smooth continuous development has been put in place we develop feature after feature and ship early and often.</p>
