<h1>Activity-Centered Design</h1>
<p class="introduction">Many times simply the wrong software is created. It may work very well.
	It may look good and is easy to use. But the organization that paid for it does not get the benefit
	from it as expected. It's because a great solution can solve the <strong>wrong problem.</strong></p>

		<p>Despite the vast improvements
			in the way how software teams create software since the Agile Manifesto was published in 2001
			still many software <strong>projects fail</strong> in one way or another.</p>
		<p>To many, the word <strong>design</strong> only describes how something looks but in fact it means how it
			<strong>works and looks</strong>. Well designed products are created based on a
			<strong>deep understanding</strong> of the
			<strong>activities</strong> users want to perform and are well engineered. This fitness makes these products
			superior to their competition and in some cases such products shake up an entire industry.
		</p>
		<p><strong>Activity-Centered Design</strong> helps to create <strong>smarter products</strong>
			that solve people's <strong>real problems</strong> by putting the focus on what people want to
			do <strong>through</strong> software instead of on how software is operated.</p>
		<h2 class="caimito-main-color">Read The book</h2>

			Stephan Schwab has written a book that teaches readers how to apply <strong>Activity Theory</strong>
			to Software Development. Drawing from a long history of <strong>psychology</strong> and
			<strong>philosophy</strong>
			Activity Theory can help practicioners to better understand what people want to do <strong>through</strong>
			software. Based on that Activity-Centered Design is a practice that enables a <strong>whole team</strong> of
			<strong>software designers</strong> to create a solution that solves the <strong>right problem</strong>
			and <strong>delights customers</strong>.

		<p>Agile development teams will find it easy to use the practices from the book. UX experts will become
			an integral part of the team.</p>
