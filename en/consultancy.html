	<p>Similar to a <strong>coach in sports</strong>, we can help you and your teams to <strong>improve</strong> the
		<strong>effectiveness</strong> of your work and the <strong>contribution</strong> to the overall <strong>value
			creation chain</strong> within the company. With pleasure we introduce new techniques for software development,
		test, project management and product development to your teams and leadership. Included in that is to improve the
		collaboration amongst management, teams and team members.
	</p>
	<p>We are not process consultants or sellers of any particular methodology. Our focus is on uplifting skills of all
		contributors in your organization so that the company as a whole improves and becomes fitter for the challenges
		ahead.

<h2>The Learning Team</h2>
<p>Teams are the smallest unit able to learn within an organization. Workgroups made of specialists deliver inferior
	performance because those specialists frequently are unable to truly collaborate. Success comes from technical
	capabilities. Sustainable long-term success comes from organizational capabilities.</p>

		<h2>Organizational Capabilities</h2>
		<p>Teams with well-developed organizational capabilities are able to act purposefully in accordance with the
			corporate purpose and continue to make useful decisions.</p>
		<p>Scrum and Kanban are useful to develop general organizational capabilities.</p>
		<p><a href="acd.html">Activity-Centered Design</a> can help to understand what people want to do through software
			and develop customers.</p>
	</div>

		<h2>Technical Capabilities</h2>
		<p>The difference between a team of advanced professionals and a team of really experienced professionals is
			caused by continuous learning. Masters of their craft are what they are because of years of practice with
			well-suited techniques.</p>
		<p><a href="atdd.html"><strong>Acceptance Test-Driven Development (ATDD)</strong></a> and <strong>Test-Driven
				Development (TDD)</strong> are useful
			techniques to develop technical excellence.</p>
		<p><strong>Continuous Integration (CI)</strong> in combination with <strong>Continuous Deployment (CD)</strong> to
			production systems helps to reap the benefits of an investment, the software being created, much sooner. Rapid
			feedback from actual users of that software also ensures that you and your team stay on the right track. </p>
		<p>Instead of struggling with complexity and lots of moving parts we help your team with <strong>trunk-based
				development</strong>
			instead of complicated branching strategies and tooling. Being able to <strong>deploy to production many times per
				day</strong> is
			what we aim for and we help you to do it without fear.</p>

<h2>Team Coaching</h2>
<p>To enable teams to purposefully work for the company they must have technical and organizational capabilities,
	which are helpful for the company. The development of these skills is through learning with the help of a team
	coach. Some call that role <em>Agile Coach</em>, others say <em>Senior Developer Advocate</em> or simply <em>Technical
		Team Coach</em>.</p>
<p>We do respect the knowledge and experience of you and all team members. We come to augment what you are already doing
	well. Our exposure to all the good things in many companies allows us to bring the best to your organization.</p>
