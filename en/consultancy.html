<p>Similar to a <strong>coach in sports</strong>, I can help you and your teams to <strong>improve</strong> the <strong>effectiveness</strong> of your work and the <strong>contribution</strong> to the overall <strong>value creation chain</strong> within the company. It is my pleasure to introduce new techniques for software development, test, project management and product development to your teams and leadership. Included in that is to improve the collaboration amongst management, teams and team members.</p>

		<p>Teams are the smallest unit able to learn within an organization. Workgroups made of specialists deliver inferior performance because those specialists frequently are unable to truly collaborate. Success comes from technical capabilities. Sustainable long-term success comes from organizational capabilities.</p>
