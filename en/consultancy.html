<h1>Prepare for the Digital Age</h1>
<h2>Excellence through sustainable development of organizational and technical capabilities
</h2>

<p>Similar to a <strong>coach in sports</strong>, we can help you and your teams to <strong>improve</strong> the
	<strong>effectiveness</strong> of your work and the <strong>contribution</strong> to the overall <strong>value
		creation chain</strong> within the company. It is my pleasure to introduce new techniques for software development,
	test, project management and product development to your teams and leadership. Included in that is to improve the
	collaboration amongst management, teams and team members.
</p>

<h2>The Learning Team</h2>
<p>Teams are the smallest unit able to learn within an organization. Workgroups made of specialists deliver inferior
	performance because those specialists frequently are unable to truly collaborate. Success comes from technical
	capabilities. Sustainable long-term success comes from organizational capabilities.</p>

		<h2>Organizational Capabilities</h2>
		<p>Teams with well-developed organizational capabilities are able to act purposefully in accordance with the
			corporate purpose and continue to make useful decisions.</p>
		<p>Scrum and Kanban are useful to develop general organizational capabilities.</p>
		<p><a href="acd.html">Activity-Centered Design</a> can help to understand what people want to do through software
			and develop customers.</p>

		<h2>Technical Capabilities</h2>
		<p>The difference between a team of advanced professionals and a team of really experienced professionals is
			caused by continuous learning. Masters of their craft are what they are because of years of practice with
			well-suited techniques.</p>
		<p><a href="atdd.html">Acceptance Test-Driven Development</a> (ATDD) and Test-Driven Development (TDD) are useful
			techniques to develop technical excellence.</p>

<h2>Team Coaching</h2>
<p>To enable teams to purposefully work for the company they must have technical and organizational capabilities,
	which are helpful for the company. The development of these skills is through learning with the help of a team
	coach.</p>
