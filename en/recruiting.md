# Technical Recruiting
Finding truly the right people for software development teams is very difficult. The experience of software developers cannot be evaluated the same way as it works in other professions. Seniority is not indicated by using the same techniques, tools, frameworks, programming languages for many years. In fact the longer a developer does the same, the less experience the person actually is.

## Hiring is Broken
The big staffing agencies ironically filter out the most suitable and capable candidates by using a process that will surface candidates who do the same over many years and are usually inflexible and in consequence suffer from learning disabilities. Software development is a very dynamic domain and what in other professions would clearly show experience does not in software development and can even be a red flag.

    Define Requirements
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>In order to find out what type of additional contributor your team needs we will talk to the senior members of your team. Indirectly we will also perform a technical assessment of the technical practices that your team uses and find any gaps or where there is room for improvement.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="step">
    Source Candidates
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>We will work with any staffing agency you already have a business relationship with. In addition we can also find candidates in our network or use social media to source candidates.</p>

  <div class="step">
    Screen Resumes
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>Unlike the staffing agencies we do understand all the technical jargon candidates use in their resumes and are able to read between the lines and look beyond.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="step">
    Conduct Interviews
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>Once we have narrowed down the list of candidates to ten people we will schedule online interviews.</p>
    <p>These ten candidates will be a mix of very well suited candidates based on their resumes and also a few unusual candidates that might be great but lack presentation skills or are too modest people.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="step">
    Evaluate and Suggest the Right Candidate
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>You will be given the resumes of one to three candidates that we find suitable. Each resume comes with an assessment based on the interview and explanation of our suggestion.</p>
    <p>For the remaining resumes we explain in writing why they were not chosen.</p>
