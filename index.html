				<h3 class="caimito-green-color">Preventing defects from the start</h3>
           		<p>Are you looking for a way to <strong>prevent</strong> defects? Then ATDD may be what you have been looking for.
				Stakeholders and your development team define together, in the form of <strong>executable specifications</strong>, 
				what the software under development should do. Defects are prevented by continuos verification of
				production code against examples of correct behavior written in <strong>human language</strong>
				(English and others).</p>
				<p><img src="/img/atdd-run.png"></p>
				<p>We put the focus on the expected <strong>behavior</strong> of the production code and we state that 
				<strong>first</strong> before diving into the details. So that we get it <strong>right</strong> from the start.</p>
				<p>By having tests in place for every piece of code we can <strong>trust</strong> our building blocks for the 
				larger piece. Instead of believing that we may have done it right, we have <strong>proof</strong> at every turn 
				of the way and can work with confidence. <strong>No sweaty hands before demos!</strong></p>

				<h3 class="caimito-green-color">Solving the right problem</h3>
           		<p>All too often simply the <strong>wrong software</strong> gets created. It may work but not as the users or 
				stakeholders expected. Or it may solve the <strong>wrong problem</strong> altogether. Despite the vast improvements
				in the way how software teams create software since the Agile Manifesto was published in 2001 
				still many software <strong>projects fail</strong> in one way or another.</p>
				<p>To many, the word <strong>design</strong> only describes how something looks but in fact it means how it
				<strong>works and looks</strong>. Well designed products are created based on a 
				<strong>deep understanding</strong> of which
				<strong>activities</strong> users want to perform and are well engineered. This fitness makes these products
				superior to their competition and in some cases such products shake up an entire industry.</p>
				<p><strong>Activity-Centered Design</strong> helps to create <strong>smarter products</strong> 
				that solve people's <strong>real problems</strong> by putting the focus on what people want to 
				do <em>through</em> software instead of on how software	is operated.</p>

				<h3 class="caimito-green-color">Building on the agile mindset</h3>
          		<p>Agile practices have helped software development teams to deliver higher quality code and better
				software solutions in numerous companies. However, the goal has never been to improve the
				<strong>efficiency</strong> of software production. Instead it is all about doing more 
				<strong>effectively</strong> what people in organizations do. Regardless of whether that doing is
				making software or something else.</p>
				<p>Learning organizations put an emphasis on <strong>inspect</strong> and <strong>adapt</strong>.
				They perform controlled experiments, measure thouroughly and then learn from the data for the next
				cycle. This has become known as the <strong>Lean Startup</strong> movement and increasingly is
				in use in medium and large enterprises.</p>
				<p>The ability to learn quickly allows all kinds of organizations to <strong>adjust</strong> to 
				<strong>fast</strong> paced <strong>change</strong> and meet the expectations of their customers -
				to be able to <strong>delight</strong> them.</p>
