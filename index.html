        			<p>Today, people are increasingly more aware and concerned about the environment 
					they live and work in. Life and work has become more interconnected and more global.
					This has resulted in faster change and creates new challenges for organizations to 
					reach their customers and retain smart collaborators.</p>

           		<p>Stakeholders and development team define together, in the form of <strong>executable spe&shy;ci&shy;fi&shy;ca&shy;tions</strong>, what the software under de&shy;ve&shy;lop&shy;ment should do.</p>

				<p>Continuous ve&shy;ri&shy;fi&shy;ca&shy;tion of production code against examples of correct behavior gives you the zero defect advantage.</p>

				<h3 class="caimito-green-color">Solving the right problem</h3>
           		<p>All too often simply the <strong>wrong software</strong> gets created. It may work but not as the users or stakeholders expected. Or it may solve the <strong>wrong problem</strong> altogether. Well designed products are created based on a <strong>deep understanding</strong> of the <strong>activities</strong> users want to perform and are well engineered. This fitness makes these products
				superior to their competition and in some cases such products shake up an entire industry.</p>
				<p>Activity-Centered Design helps to create <strong>smarter products</strong> 
				that solve people's <strong>real problems</strong> by putting the focus on what people want to 
				do <strong>through</strong> software instead of on how software	is operated.</p>

          		<h2 class="caimito-main-color">Learning Organization</h2>
				<h3 class="caimito-green-color">Building on the agile mindset</h3>
				<p>The ability to learn quickly allows all kinds of organizations to <strong>adjust</strong> to <strong>fast</strong> paced <strong>change</strong> and meet the expectations of their customers - to be able to <strong>delight</strong> them.</p>
          		<p>The goal of agile practices has <strong>never</strong> been to improve the <strong>efficiency</strong> of software <strong>pro&shy;duc&shy;tion</strong>. Instead it is all about doing more <strong>effectively</strong> what people in organizations do. Regardless of whether that doing is making software or something else.</p>
				<p>Learning organizations put an emphasis on <strong>inspect</strong> and <strong>adapt</strong>. They perform controlled experiments, measure thouroughly and then learn from the data for the next cycle. This has become known as the <strong>Lean Startup</strong> move&shy;ment and increasingly is in use in medium and large enterprises.</p>
