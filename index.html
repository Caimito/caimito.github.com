           		<p>Stakeholders and development team define together, in the form of <strong>executable spe&shy;ci&shy;fi&shy;ca&shy;tions</strong>, what the software under de&shy;ve&shy;lop&shy;ment should do.</p>

				<p>Continuous ve&shy;ri&shy;fi&shy;ca&shy;tion of production code against examples of correct behavior gives you the zero defect advantage.</p>

				<h3 class="caimito-green-color">Solving the right problem</h3>
           		<p>All too often simply the <strong>wrong software</strong> gets created. It may work but not as the users or stakeholders expected. Or it may solve the <strong>wrong problem</strong> altogether. Well designed products are created based on a <strong>deep understanding</strong> of the <strong>activities</strong> users want to perform and are well engineered. This fitness makes these products
				superior to their competition and in some cases such products shake up an entire industry.</p>
				<p>Activity-Centered Design helps to create <strong>smarter products</strong> 
				that solve people's <strong>real problems</strong> by putting the focus on what people want to 
				do <strong>through</strong> software instead of on how software	is operated.</p>

				<h3 class="caimito-green-color">Building on the agile mindset</h3>
				<p>The ability to learn quickly allows all kinds of organizations to <strong>adjust</strong> to <strong>fast</strong> paced <strong>change</strong> and meet the expectations of their customers - to be able to <strong>delight</strong> them.</p>
          		<p>The goal of agile practices has <strong>never</strong> been to improve the <strong>efficiency</strong> of software <strong>pro&shy;duc&shy;tion</strong>. Instead it is all about doing more <strong>effectively</strong> what people in organizations do. Regardless of whether that doing is making software or something else.</p>
				<p>Learning organizations put an emphasis on <strong>inspect</strong> and <strong>adapt</strong>. They perform controlled experiments, measure thouroughly and then learn from the data for the next cycle.</p>
